# Sorting-and-Searching-Algorithms-for-Data-Analytics

-This project is part of the "Data Structures" course in the Computer Science and Informatics Department of the University of Patras-.

The files agn.us.txt, ainv.us.txt, ale.us.txt contain complete historical data with daily prices for three stocks traded on the NYSE and NASDAQ securities exchanges from 2005 to 2017. Each line of these files corresponds to a single day of record of each stock's movement.
Each line of these files corresponds to a single day of record of each stock's movement, and has the following format:
Date, Open, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, OpenInt

Four different programs have been implemented in C++, using the above files as input and each implementing the following functions:

1) Sort in ascending order of dates (Date field) based on the opening prices (Open field) of the shares using the Merge Sort and Quick Sort algorithms.
2) Sort in ascending order of dates (Date field) based on the closing prices (Close field) of the shares using the Heap Sort and Counting Sort algorithms.
3) Finding the total trading volume (Volume field) in the shares of the agn.us.txt file for a specific date (Date) given by the user, according to the Binary Search and Interpolated Search algorithms.
4) Î¤he question (3) using the BIS algorithm.
